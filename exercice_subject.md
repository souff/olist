# Exercise 1: olist batch processing

## Initial request :

- Using [olist dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce), identify all late deliveries, so that we can provide a 10% discount on next delivery to boost the sales

- order_purchase_timestamp is by default in Sao Paulo timezone

- order_delivered_customer_date is by default in the customer delivery address timezone



## Result:

- A csv file with list of customers having late deliveries (more than 10 days)



## To provide

- git clone <repository>

- a README.md file explain how to reproduce the result



## Evaluation (100 points, 50 points required to have the module)
